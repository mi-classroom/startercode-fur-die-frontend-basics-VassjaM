    <h1>Design Methods</h1>
    <hr>

    <p>After discussing the design principles necessary for a good user experience, this section elaborates on specific
        ways to approach the design process.
    </p>

    <h2>Community-Centered Design</h2>

    <p>It is important to provide members within a community the opportunity to interact with each other (PREECES, 2004,
        P. 3FF). According to Preece, developing online communities is different from designing software as software,
        once shipped, is stable and does not change until the next update while online communities develop and change
        through dynamic interactions. It is first and foremost a social experience that changes according to who is
        participating, the number of people involved, and the type of discussion that takes place (IBID., P.4). For
        example, the dynamics between new and long-established communities differ notably. While the software might not
        change drastically, social interactions will adapt according to the growth of the community. This social
        adaption is called “sociability” (IBID.). <br>
        In many online communities, these social changes are at least as influential as software changes. Therefore,
        crucial to not only focus on the usability of the design but also on sociability. Therefore, knowledge from
        different disciplines such as sociology, social psychology, anthropology, as well as user-centered design is
        required (IBID.). In participatory community-centered design methodology (→ FIG. 07), members of the community
        are involved in the design process from the beginning. In community-centered design, six phases are each
        followed by an evaluation period and iterations based on the findings.

    <h3>Assess the Needs of the Community</h3>

    <p>The first step involves understanding the community. This means understanding the community’s needs. It is
        important to understand who the members of the community are and what the main purpose of the community is. It
        is about understanding for whom this community exists and what the participants’ habits are (PREECE, 2004, P.
        4).
    </p>


    <h3>Select a Technology Plan for Sociability</h3>

    <p>After understanding the potential members of the community, it is important to select the technology for
        communication within the community. Suitable mediums, such as timelines, discussion boards, or chat areas, must
        be discussed and the software should be tailored to suit the needs of the community (PREECE, 2004, P. 4F.).
